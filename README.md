## Maze-Generation-Search-with-BFS-in-Processing

This Python script uses the Processing library to generate a maze, solve it using both Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS), and visualize the process. The script creates a maze with start and end points, obstacles, and a goal. It then employs BFS algorithm to find a path from start to goal, displaying the visited cells for visualization.

Instructions
Requirements:
Python with Processing library installed.
Setup:
Ensure you have the Processing library installed for Python.
Run the script in a Python environment.

Usage:
The maze will be generated and solved using both BFS.
Observe the visualization of the process.
Visualization:

The maze generation and solving algorithms are implemented with inspiration from various sources.
